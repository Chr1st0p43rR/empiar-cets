#   ImageAcquisitionProtocol:
#     - title: "Cryo-electron tomography"
#       protocol_description: "Cryo-electron tomograms were acquired on a Titan Krios microscope operated at 300 kV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a field-emission gun, a quantum post-column energy filter (Gatan) and a K3 direct detector (Gatan). Data was collected in low-dose mode using automation scripts in SerialEM. Tilt series were acquired from -60° to +60° in 2° increments at a magnification of 26,000x with a calibrated pixel size of 3.425 Å, using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme, defocus range of 2-4 μm, and keeping the total accumulated dose below 150 e-/A2. 14 tilt series were acquired for the glucose control and 26 tilt series for the starvation condition. Prior to tomogram reconstruction, tilt movie frames were corrected for gain reference and beam-induced motion in Warp 1.0.9 alongside contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation. Tomograms were aligned and reconstructed by weighted back-projection in AreTomo at 4x binning, corresponding to a pixel size of 13.7 Å."

#     - title: "Cryo-FIB milling preparation"
#       protocol_description: "Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BY4741) were recovered from frozen stocks (stored at −80°C) and streaked onto YPAD agar plates. Cells were grown for 3 days at 30°C before single colonies were re-streaked onto fresh plates and grown for 2 days. Single colonies were picked to inoculate 20 mL of synthetic media supplemented with 20 mM dextrose (glucose control medium). Liquid cultures were incubated overnight at 30°C and shaking at 165 rpm to grow cells to exponential phase. Cells at OD600 of 0.5–0.6 were centrifuged, resuspended in either glucose control medium or synthetic medium with 100 mM sorbitol (starvation medium) and washed twice. Cells were incubated in respective medium for 30 min before plunge-freezing. 4 μL of cell suspension were deposited on glow discharged holey Quantifoil silicon dioxide grids (R1/2, Cu 200 mesh), blotted for 1–2 s, and plunged into liquid ethane. Cellular slices (lamellae) of ~200 nm thickness were generated by cryo-FIB milling in an Aquilos cryo-FIB/SEM microscope. Grids were sputter-coated with platinum and coated with organometallic platinum. Milling was performed with a gallium ion beam at 30 kV. Automated rough-milling used currents of 1 nA, 0.5 nA and 0.3 nA to thin cells to 5 μm, 3 μm and 1 μm, respectively. Lamellae were manually thinned to 200 nm using 50 pA current and given a final platinum sputter coating."
#   AnnotationMethod:
#     - title: "Particle picking"
#       protocol_description: "Ribosome particles were picked from tomograms using the template-based particle picking tool in EMAN2.2. Particles were picked from 10 tomograms for the glucose control condition and 20 tomograms for the starvation condition. The template used for picking was a 3D model of a ribosome. Picked particles were manually inspected and cleaned to remove false positives and false negatives. The final particle coordinates were used for subtomogram averaging."
